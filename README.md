# EDD-Slack-Notifications--Add-Customer-Data

This plugin is an extension for https://github.com/tubiz/edd-slack-notifications

Edd Slack Notification must be installed and activated.

This plugin adds to the message sent to Slack the customer informations: Name, last name and email. Requires my fork of https://github.com/tubiz/edd-slack-notifications


*Attention* : this plugins utilizes a filter hook that for the moment is present only on my fork of _Easy Digital Downloads - Slack Notifications_ .

I created a pull request to incorporate the new filter on the official release of Slack Notification. In the meantime you can use my fork here: https://github.com/garubi/edd-slack-notifications
